## October 7th - Main Menu & Options Menu

I developed a simple menu interface for the game. There are three options *Start*, *Options* and *Exit*, right now *start* simply brings the player to the next scene of the game (Not implemented yet). *Exit* prints to the console to prove the button is functional. And *Options* brings the player to another menu. In this menu I have created the visual UI for the player to lower the ***sound and music*** of the game (Right now they are not functionl). The player can also return to the first menu from here. In order to learn what I did today I consulted a tutorial on youtube. [Tutorial on how to make a basic menu](https://youtu.be/zc8ac_qUXQY)
